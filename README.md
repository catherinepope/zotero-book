# Zotero guide

I'm making my book __Getting Started with Zotero__ open source and open access. Once I've finished converting everything to Markdown, anyone will be able to view or contribute to the project. 

Every time it's updated, the content is automatically built into a website, using Hugo and Netlify.

The site uses the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme and will be publicly available soon.
