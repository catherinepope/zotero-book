Another way of creating an association between multiple Items is with the ‘Related’ tab. This is useful for establishing connections, such as between a novel and a journal article that discusses it. You could also use it to link different volumes of the same work. 

Choose the relevant Item in the middle column, then click the Related tab in the right-hand column. Click Add and then either browse or search to locate the related Item.

Here I’ve linked a journal article with a novel.

You can include as many related items as you like. Clicking on a related item will take you to it, so it’s easy to move around.
