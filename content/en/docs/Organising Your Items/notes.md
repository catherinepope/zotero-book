In Zotero you can add notes to individual Items, and also create standalone notes. 

To add a note to an individual Item, select it in the middle column then click the Notes tab in the right-hand column. Click Add and then youâ€™ll see a mini editor with formatting toolbar.

This feature is similar to a Word document, so you can add detailed information, such as your thoughts about the book or article. As your Zotero library is automatically backed up to the server, this is a good way of keeping your notes safe. To make it easier to type you can click Edit in a Separate Window to make the editor full-screen.

The note appears directly below the Item. You can delete it by right-clicking (ctrl-clicking) and choosing Move Item to Bin (from where it can be retrieved if you change your mind).

## Adding Standalone Notes

To create a standalone note, click the yellow icon next to the magic wand. Start typing and your note will appear in the middle column. You can then click and drag it to a Collection in the left-hand column. These notes are useful for recording general thoughts or reminders.

You can edit an existing note by double-clicking it. The contents of all your notes are searchable -- signpost
