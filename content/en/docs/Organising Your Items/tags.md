Tagging is an easy method of categorizing items by adding keywords. These Tags allow you to filter your items in a variety of ways, as we shall see. Tags never appear in your bibliography or citations – they exist purely to help organise your Items. 

To add a Tag, first highlight your Item in the middle column, click the Tags tab in the right-hand column, then click ‘Add’.

Type the name of your Tag and click Add again. Repeat this process to add more Tags. To remove a Tag, click the minus sign next to it.

Your new Tag should appear below the left-hand column, in the Tag Selector. If the Tag Selector isn't visible, press Ctrl+Shift+t (Cmd+Shift+t on Mac) to restore it.

Clicking on a Tag displays all the Items with which it is associated. If you end up with hundreds of Tags, you can use the search box to locate them more quickly.

You can assign a Tag to multiple Items by dragging them from the middle column onto the relevant Tag.

## Disabling Automatic Tags

Sometimes Items imported from databases will come with their own Tags, most of which are a bit lengthy and meaningless. You can disable this annoying feature in Preferences. Click Edit at the top of your Zotero window, then Preferences, then the General tab. Uncheck the box Automatically tag items with keywords and subject headings.

If some automatic Tags have already crept it, you can either just delete them by right-clicking (ctrl-clicking on Mac) and choosing Delete Tag, or hide them by clicking the small multi-coloured icon next to the search box and unticking Show Automatic.

If you dislike all the automatic tags, there’s an option to Delete Automatic Tags in This Library.

## Assigning colours to Tags

A good way of identifying and easily locating important Tags is to colour-code them. For instance, you might have a tbr (to be read) tag or a borrow tag to flag books you need to borrow from the library. Right-click (command-click on Mac) the Tag in the Tag Selector and choose Assign Colour. You can choose colours for up to nine tags.

Any Items with coloured Tags assigned to them are flagged with a matching blob in the middle column. It’s then easy to see at a glance any Items you need to borrow or read.

The Tag is also assigned a number, which becomes a keyboard shortcut for assigning it to one of your items. In this case, pressing 1 adds the tbr Tag to the highlighted Item.
