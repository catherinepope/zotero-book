As we saw earlier, Zotero automatically downloads a PDF (if available) for journal articles. These attachments take up space on the Zotero server and the limit for free storage is 300Mb (for an annual fee of $20 you can have 2Gb). If you have hundreds of PDFs and don’t want to pay for extra storage, you can link to the file elsewhere on your computer without importing it into Zotero. This method doesn’t take up any space in your online library, but the file won’t be available to you on other computers (although Zotero can index the content so that it is searchable through zotero.org). Right-click on an Item and choose Add Attachment, then Attach Link to File. You can also attach Word documents, but you won’t be able to open them unless you have Word installed.

Dropbox and Evernote users can create a URL for a file and associate it with an Item by right-clicking, choosing Add Attachment, then Attach Link to URI. As I mentioned earlier, you need to check for copyright restrictions on storing published material.

Here's how to link to a journal article that you've saved to Dropbox:

1. Go to Dropbox.com and find the relevant file.
2. Click the Share button next to the file name and then Share with Dropbox.
3. Click Create link in the bottom right-hand corner.
4. Dropbox creates the link in the background, then you’ll see the option to Copy link.
5. Return to Zotero. Right-click on your item, click Add Attachment and choose Attach Link to URI. Paste the Dropbox link into the box, add a meaningful title, and click OK.
6. Now you should see that the Dropbox link is attached to your item. You can view the PDF by selecting the attachment and clicking the link on the right.
