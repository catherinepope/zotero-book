As explained earlier, My Library holds all your Items. They can also be organised into different Collections, each with their own sub-collections. A Collection is simply a list of Items, such as all the references for a thesis chapter or journal article. You can create as many Collections as you need, and your items can appear in multiple Collections.

To add a new Collection, click the folder icon in the top left-hand corner, just above My Library.

Type a name for your Collection and press enter or click OK. You can create sub-collections by clicking and dragging them into another Collection.

Items can then be dragged and dropped into your new Collection from the middle column. When a Collection is selected, any new Items you create or save will be added to that Collection.

Right-click (ctrl-click on Mac) the Collection to rename it, delete it, or to add a sub-collection. Deleting an Item from a Collection does not remove it completely – it will still appear in My Library. Similarly, deleting a Collection doesn’t remove everything within it unless you choose Delete Collection and Items from the menu.

To find out which Collection an item belongs to, select it in the middle column then press Ctrl (Alt/Option on Mac). The Collection is then highlighted in yellow.

You can view any Items that aren't in a Collection by clicking Unfiled Items under My Library.
