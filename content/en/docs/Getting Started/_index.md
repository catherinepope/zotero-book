When you first open Zotero, it looks a bit sparse. Don’t worry – we’ll soon liven it up with your bibliographic data. 
Terms I’m going to be using:

- **Library** – this is everything you’ve saved to Zotero
- **Collection** – a subset of your library
- **Item** – a single reference (this could be a book, journal article, webpage, or just about anything else)
- **Tag** – a descriptive label applied to an item

Here’s an overview of the Zotero interface:



The left-hand column is My Library. Here’s where you keep your collections, saved searches, and other libraries. At the bottom, you’ll find the Tag Selector, which we’ll meet later.

You can see that Collections are used to group together Items for specific projects, such as a thesis, journal article, or book chapter. 

The centre pane displays the Items contained in whatever Collection, search, or tag is selected.

The right-hand pane shows you the details of the Item you’ve selected in the centre pane. You’ll notice there are some tabs across the top for Notes, Tags, and Related. You’ll find out about those in Chapter Five.

Across the top is the toolbar. Here’s where you create collections, add items manually, and search your library. Again, I’ll introduce you to all those features over the coming chapters.

It’ll become much clearer as you start using the features and adding some Items. Let’s do that now.
