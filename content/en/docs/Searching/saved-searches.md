You’ll see there’s an option to save your search. This creates a list of your results that is automatically updated when matching items are added to your Library.

Saved searches appear in the left-hand column, below your collections. They resemble a folder with a magnifying glass.

This example is a saved search that shows journal articles tagged tbr. If this tag is applied to another article, it’s automatically added to the saved search.
