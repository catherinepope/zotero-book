For a more sophisticated search, click the magnifying glass above the middle column.

You can then specify your search terms.

1. Decide whether you want to match all or any of your search criteria
2. Specify the field to be searched (there is also an option to search Attachment Content for PDFs)
3. Choose your condition:
- contains – finds Items that contain your search term
- is – finds Items that match your search term exactly
- is not – finds Items that do not match your exact search term
- does not contain – finds items that don’t contain your search term (e.g. you could find everything that doesn’t mention Dickens in the title)
4. Enter your search term
5. Click the plus sign to add more search criteria (make sure you’ve chosen Match all in stage one if you want the Items to meet all your criteria).

In this example, the search locates any journal articles tagged tbr that contain ‘Queen Victoria’ in the title.

The % (wildcard) allows you to search for parts of words. For example, scien% matches science, sciences, scientific, scientist. %scien% also matches conscience, conscientious, as it includes any characters that precede the search term.
