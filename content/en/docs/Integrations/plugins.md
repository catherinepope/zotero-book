First, you need to make sure the plugin is installed. Go to the Cite tab under Preferences, then the Word Processors tab and it will tell you whether you need to install it.

While you’re there, check the box for Use classic Add Citation dialog. This will make citing references more straightforward while you’re getting used to Zotero.

Now open Word. Where the Zotero toolbar appears is determined by whether you’re using a PC or a Mac, and also by the version of Word. For Windows users, it generally appears in its own tab at the top. For Mac users, it is often perched on top of Word. 

The first icon, Add/Edit Citation is the one you’ll be using most; then comes Add/Edit Bibliography, Document Preferences, Refresh, and Unlink Citations. You won’t be using the last three very often, but we’ll look at what they do in a moment.
