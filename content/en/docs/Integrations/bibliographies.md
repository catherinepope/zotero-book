Once you’ve added all your citations, it’s a breeze to generate a bibliography. This is the point at which users typically fall in love with Zotero (gasps have been heard in workshops). Place your cursor at the end of the document and click Add/Edit Bibliography in the Zotero toolbar. Zotero inserts formatted references for all your citations and arranges them alphabetically. Admittedly, that’s not very exciting if you’re working on a short document, but it’s marvellous for a thesis or a book that might contain hundreds, or even thousands, of citations. 

You can edit the bibliography by clicking anywhere within it and choosing Add/Edit Bibliography from the Zotero toolbar and (1) add/remove Items using the arrows. Here you can also tweak the item in a mini editor (2).

Any changes you make in the mini editor won’t be reflected in your Zotero library. To make a permanent change, edit the item in Zotero, then click Refresh on the Zotero toolbar in Word.
To change to a different citation style, click Document Preferences in the Zotero toolbar. This affects only the current document (it won’t change the style in any other files in which you’ve cited references using Zotero).

If you want to detach your document from Zotero, for example if you decided to use a different bibliographic referencing tool, click Unlink Citations in the toolbar. It might be worth taking a copy first, though, just in case you change your mind – it cannot be reversed.

## Standalone bibliographies

Sometimes you’ll just want a bibliography on its own, e.g. for a reading list. You can generate one from within Zotero.

To generate a bibliography from a Collection, right-click (command-click on Mac) it under My Library and choose Create Bibliography from Collection.

You’ll then be given some choices.

- Save as RTF – Rich Text Format, suitable for use in most word processors.
- Save as HTML – provides a format viewable in a web browser, thus allowing users to add the citations to their own Zotero library using the browser connector.
- Copy to Clipboard – for pasting your bibliography into another program.
- Print – sends your bibliography straight to the printer.

You can also use this process with Items from across different Collections. Select them in the middle column, right-click (command-click on Mac) and then choose Create Bibliography from Selected Items.
