To insert a citation in Word, place your cursor at the end of the quote and click Add/Edit Citation. The first time you do this, Zotero asks you to choose a referencing style. This can be changed at any time, so don’t worry too much about choosing the right one immediately. We’ll look at how to add or change styles in a later chapter. 

You can decide whether your citations should appear as footnotes or endnotes – again, you can change this later.

Your Zotero library then appears. From here, you can either browse through your collections or use the search box to find an Item.

Click on the Item you require, then you can add additional information, such as the page number (1) and a prefix and/or suffix (2). In the example above, I’ve added a prefix of ‘Cited in’ to indicate that this is a secondary source, and a suffix of ‘(italicization mine)’ to explain that I’ve added italics for emphasis. When you’ve finished, click OK and the formatted citation appears.

To make changes, make sure you’ve selected the citation in Word, then click Add/Edit Citation.
You can also cite multiple sources by clicking the Multiple Sources icon and adding them to a list.

Click on the Item you want to add, then click the green arrow. You can also move them up and down or remove them from the list with the other arrows. As before, you can add pages numbers, prefixes, and suffixes for each of them.

There’s a quicker method of adding citations in Word, once you’re familiar with how it works. Go back to the Cite tab in Preferences and uncheck the box that says, Use Classic Add Citation dialog. Now when you click Add/Edit Citation, you’ll get a bubble instead.

Start typing an author or title and Zotero will find it for you. Click on the Item to add your page number or any other information.
