You can also use Zotero with Google Docs. It works in a similar way to the Word plugin. Here's what it looks like:

First make sure you have the Zotero browser connector installed. You'll then see a Zotero toolbar when you open a document. This gives you access to many of the features that we saw in the Word tutorial. There's a Zotero icon that looks like a big Z. Click this to insert a citation. The first time you do this, you'll be prompted to authenticate the connection – you have to give Zotero permission to access your Google account. You also need to have Zotero open.

There are currently a few limitations to Zotero functionality in Google Docs. The main difference is performance – you’ll find it slow if you have more than a hundred citations. You can keep up-to-date with developments on the Zotero support pages.
