If you have a folder of journal article PDFs, it’s very easy to add them to Zotero and retrieve the bibliographic data. Click and drag your PDF into the middle column (make sure it doesn’t attach itself to an existing Item), then Zotero will automatically retrieve the details, create an Item, and attach the PDF to it. It’ll even rename the PDF using the data it’s found. Magic.
