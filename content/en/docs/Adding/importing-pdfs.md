## Adding Multiple Items

You can also use automatic capture for adding multiple items. I’m now going to show you an example using journal articles. A database search here has produced a list of relevant journal articles and Zotero has displayed a folder icon in my address bar. A folder denotes multiple compatible items:

If I click on the folder, Zotero shows me a list of those articles and I can check the ones I want it to import. I can also Select All to import them all.

Once I’ve chosen the articles I want, I click OK, and then Zotero starts importing them. If you’ve chosen a lot of articles, it might take a few minutes for them to appear in your Library. This is because Zotero is cleverly downloading and attaching the PDF version of the article, if available – so, you’ll have the bibliographic data and the full text. Great, isn’t it? At the risk of spoiling your fun, you should check any copyright restrictions on storing published material.

If Zotero isn’t allowed to download the PDF, you can attach it manually to an Item. Locate the file on your computer, then click and drag it onto the Item in Zotero. Alternatively, you can right-click (or command-click on Mac) the Item, then choose Add Attachment > Attach Stored Copy of File.

Here is my journal article. Just click on the tiny arrow you’ll see the associated PDF. A small blue circle to the right of an Item denotes an attachment.

You might notice that the attached PDFs sometimes don’t have meaningful titles.

Zotero can actually rename them by searching the article for relevant information. Right-click (ctrl-click on Mac) the PDF and choose Rename File from Parent Metadata.

As you can see, this example now has a much more helpful filename.

This doesn’t matter within Zotero, as the PDF is attached to its record. However, it would be helpful if you wanted to edit the file in another application and save it elsewhere.
