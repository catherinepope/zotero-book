You might already be using EndNote to manage your references, in which case you’ll want to import them into Zotero. Here's how to do it in three easy steps.

## 1) Specify a new output format in EndNote

This exports your library in a format that can be understood by Zotero.

In EndNote, click Edit on the top menu, then Output Styles, then Open Style Manager.

Keep scrolling down the list of styles until you find one called RefMan (RIS) Export (alternatively, pressing the letter r on your keyboard should take you there more quickly).

Check the box next to RefMan (RIS) Export, then click the smaller x in the top right-hand corner to close the style manager (don’t click the bigger X, else it’ll close EndNote.

## 2) Export your EndNote library
   
Click File > Export and you’ll be prompted to save the file. Choose Text File for Save as Type and RefMan (RIS) Export as the Output Style. Make sure the box is unchecked where it says Export Selected References, otherwise you’ll only export the items that are currently selected in EndNote.

Click Save and the file is created for you.

You can now close EndNote, and you never have to see it again.

## 3) Import into Zotero

In Zotero, click File > Import. Find the file you created in the previous step (it’s called My EndNote Library) then click Open.

Zotero will start importing your EndNote library.

You should now see that Zotero has created a new Collection called My EndNote Library, which now contains all your imported items. In the next chapter I'll be showing you how you can move your items to other collections.

Unfortunately, Zotero won’t retain your EndNote groups, but this method does save you a lot of inputting.
