## Adding Items Manually

Old, rare, or obscure publications might not exist on any database, so you’ll need to enter those manually. Click the green plus sign icon and choose the publication type (Zotero automatically shows the five most popular types, and this will automatically update to those that you use most frequently). Clicking more reveals another few dozen types.

Then just fill in the details you need. For multiple authors, click the plus sign next to the field (or use the keyboard shortcut of Shift+Enter). You can also add a contributor, editor, series editor, or translator.

## Adding Book Sections

You’ll almost certainly need to add book sections manually. This includes contributions to edited collections, such as essays. Here’s the easiest way to do it:

1.	Add the book using Library Hub Discover or another database.
2.	Duplicate the item by right-clicking and choosing Duplicate Item.
3.	Change the Item Type to Book Section. Now you’ll have a blank Title field. This is where you add the title of the chapter. 
4.	Add the author of the chapter by clicking the plus sign. You also need to include the page numbers.

Here’s what my citation looks like:

> Margree, Victoria, ‘Marriage in Women’s Short Fiction’, in _For Better, for Worse: Marriage in Victorian Novels by Women_, ed. by Carolyn Lambert and Marion Shaw, 1st edn (London: Taylor and Francis, 2017), pp. 175–90.

Repeat this process if you need to add additional chapters from the same collection.

## Adding Multi-Volume Works

If you’re working with old books, you probably have some works in multiple parts. Victorians were very fond of the triple-decker or three-volume novels. Although they look very attractive on the shelf, they’re a nuisance to cite. You have to find the right volume and page number each time. Adding them to Zotero is quick, though. Create the first volume, then right-click and Duplicate Item a couple of times. Then simply change the volume number.
