If you're adding stuff to Zotero in a frenzy, it's very easy to end up with duplicates that will cause confusion later. However, you can easily identify them by clicking Duplicate Items under your Collections in the left-hand column.

Take care before you hit the delete key, though. Some duplicates might be valid, such as multiple volumes of the same title, or sections of a newspaper.

Click on one of the Items and you'll be asked whether you want to merge it with the duplicates. Choose which one you want to be the master, i.e. the better quality data, then click the Merge X items button.
