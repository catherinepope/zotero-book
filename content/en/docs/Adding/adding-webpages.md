{{% /pageinfo %}}


To save a webpage in Zotero, just click the icon that appears by the address bar:

It will then save the title of the page, the website name, the URL, and the date on which you accessed it. Zotero also saves a snapshot of the webpage. This means you will always be able to view the content of the webpage, even if itâ€™s updated or deleted.

Just double-click on the snapshot to view it in your browser.

As you can see here by the link, my browser is showing a saved version, rather than the live webpage. This copy is now preserved.
