## What is Zotero?

Zotero (pronounced zoh-TAIR-oh) is a free tool to help you collect, manage, cite, and share your bibliographic information. It’s a personal digital library with an easy-to-use and intuitive interface. If you’re handling more than a few dozen citations in your research project, Zotero will make life much easier for you. It’s available for Mac, Windows, and Linux, and also works across most mobile devices, so you’ll have your Zotero library wherever you go. 

Zotero detects when a book or article is being viewed in your web browser and allows you to save the full bibliographic data with a single click. If the full text of the article is available, Zotero will save that, too. You can then add notes and tags to your references and quickly organise them into collections by dragging and dropping. This flexibility means you can arrange your references in a way that suits you and your research project.

Anything saved to your Zotero library is searchable, including the full text of PDF articles and archived web pages. Even if you’re not highly organised, you’ll still be able to find everything.

With a few clicks, you can export bibliographies in a variety of formats, and it works with MS Word, LibreOffice and Google Docs, allowing you to easily insert citations while you write. Zotero includes all the major referencing styles, and thousands of journal specific styles are available for download.

In short, it’s great!

## Who is behind it? 

Zotero is a project of the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. As an educational institution, they have an interest in the availability of a really good tool for managing bibliographic data. Consequently, they’re committed to the development of Zotero and ensuring its long-term future. Which brings me to why I’m recommending Zotero.
 
## Why Zotero?

There are now at least half-a-dozen widely used reference management applications, all of which have their fans. I’m going to mention a couple of them very briefly to explain why I’m championing Zotero. EndNote, owned by Thomson Reuters, used to be the industry leader. Although EndNote is similar to Zotero in terms of functionality, many users (including me) find the interface rather clunky, and it has an unfortunate tendency to mess up formatting in Word. I’ve encountered quite a few distraught doctoral researchers who have been obliged to retype their entire theses after EndNote caused problems. You also have to pay around £80 for the privilege of installing it on your own computer – rather a lot of money for something that might make you unhappy.

A few years ago, Mendeley seemed to be heading for world domination, thanks to its glamorous interface and social networking functionality. However, when in 2013 it was purchased by publishing giant Elsevier for squillions of dollars, many users feared for the future of their data, with theories abounding that the company wanted to destroy a product that threatened their business model. Their motives remain unclear, which is exactly why (in my opinion) it’s not a smart place to keep your valuable bibliographic data.

I’m recommending Zotero because it’s well established, well supported, and non-commercial, which are good criteria for endorsing any software. As it’s free, you never have to worry about your license expiring. I’ve also run many workshops on Zotero and have seen the delight on researchers’ faces when they realise just how useful this tool is. There was even a whoop of delight during one session. Has a Microsoft product ever made you whoop? I thought not.

I am not affiliated in any way with Zotero – I’m just an evangelical user – and this ebook is not endorsed by Zotero.
What this ebook covers

In this ebook I introduce Zotero to you, demonstrating its many features and how you can use them to streamline your research and writing. 

As you’re probably already working on a complex research project, I’m keeping this guide as simple as possible so you can quickly find the information you need. You probably don’t want loads more stuff to read.
Through screenshots, I provide you with step-by-step instructions to get you started. In less than an hour, you can have Zotero installed and your digital library set up.

At the end, I'll also tell you about some third-party apps that extend Zotero's functionality.
Who this ebook is for

This ebook is for anyone who is working with references, citations, and bibliographies and wants a better way of managing them. You might be an academic, a student, or a non-fiction writer.

## Assumptions

I’m not assuming prior experience of Zotero, or any other bibliographic management software, but I am expecting a reasonable level of IT literacy, e.g. that you know what I mean by copying and pasting and right-clicking (control-clicking on the Mac). 
Also, I’m assuming you have a desktop computer or laptop, an internet connection, and the necessary permissions to install software (this might not be the case on a work or university computer). You should also have MS Word or OpenOffice installed if you want to create citations with Zotero. Alternatively, you could use Google Docs, although there are a few limitations (see Chapter Seven).

The screenshots in this ebook are from Windows version 5.0.93 of Zotero, but the interface is very similar on a Mac. I’ll highlight any differences as we go along.

## How to use this book

You don’t need to read all this ebook if you’re already familiar with some aspects of Zotero. You can jump around using either the table of contents or the hyperlinks. 

OK, if you already have Zotero installed, you can skip to Getting Started, otherwise let’s do that now.
